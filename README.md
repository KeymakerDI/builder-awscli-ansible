# builder-awscli-ansible
Docker image providing AWS cli and Ansible for use in a build pipeline.

The motivation behind the image was to group a set of tools I
frequently need and have them reasonably updated on a recent
lightweight operating system.


## Tools provided by image

* initial version:  
  aws cli, s3cmd, ansible, zip, jq
* v2.0.0:  
  aws cli, s3cmd, ansible, zip, jq, **bash (+)**


## Build

```
docker build -t builder-aws-ansible .
```

## Usage

The image is expected to be run inside a (build) pipeline, which should
handle setting environment variables and mounting volumes. Read the
[AWS cli documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cli/) for details on authentication.
The easiest way it to set these:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<id>"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<key>"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="<region>"
```

When configured, run whatever commands is required to perform the
wanted tasks, typically utilzing the AWS cli and Ansible.

The entrypoint is set to _/bin/sh_.

## Roadmap

Very little is planned for this image!
Maintenance:

 * update version of included tools
 * add other utility tools (typically used in shell scripts)
